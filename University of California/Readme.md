ETDs of University of California system was crawled and downloaded from https://escholarship.org

Besides downloading them, I scraped the webpage and extracted metadata from there. One example webpage is: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5zz34858


Some notes if someone wants to use it later:

Create log.txt file.

Create "urls" & "etds" directory first before running the parsers. Keep the parsers alongside with these directories.

Inside etds create-
 - ucb [berkley]
 - ucd [Davis]
 - uci [Irvine]
 - ucla [LA]
 - ucm [Merced]
 - ucr [Riverside]
 - ucsd [San Diego]
 - ucsf 
 - ucsb [santa barbara]
 - ucsc [santa cruz]
